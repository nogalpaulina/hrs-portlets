# MyUW hrs-portlets change log

## HRS Portlets 5 series

The HRS Portlets 5 major version was occasioned by the breaking change of
removing access to the direct deposit and W4 update forms, and with these the
`ROLE_VIEW_DIRECT_DEPOSIT` role and the `directDepositSelfServiceUrl`
portlet-preference. (There's no harm in continuing to set this preference; it
just no longer has any effect.)

However, in HRS Portlets 5.2 the links to the W4 update form and the direct
deposit intructions form were restored to service, with support for
`ROLE_VIEW_DIRECT_DEPOSIT` and the `Direct Deposit` URL from the HRS URLs
DAO. (Each of these links (tax withholdings, direct deposit) only appears on a
single tab within Payroll Information as of 5.2.) Support for
`directDepositSelfServiceUrl` `portlet-preference` was *not* restored; the
direct deposit button either uses its hard coded URL linking to the PDF form or
it sources its URL from the HRS URLs web service.

### (Unreleased)

+ Fix Payroll Information earnings statements table to stop trying to open
  earnings statements via `javascript:window.open({url})` and instead use a more
  typical `<a href="{url}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`
  ( [HRSPLT-398][], [#160][])

### 5.8.5 fix troubleshooter

2018-11-09

+ Fix troubleshooter.jsp to reflect changes to names of JavaBean properties on
  SimpleEarningsStatement

### 5.8.4 fix JSP syntax error

2018-11-09

Fix:

+ Close a c:choose tag

### 5.8.3 Open PeopleSoft earnings statements using window.open

2018-11-09

Fix:

+ The PeopleSoft PDF code opens the PDF file in a new tab. So the PeopleSoft page has some
  JavaScript on it that tries to close itself so that the user does not have 2 tabs open for each
  earnings statement link they click. However, that JavaScript is only able to close the tab if the
  tab was opened via JavaScript. So, open PeopleSoft earnings statement PDF links via
  `javascript:window.open('https://...?pacheck_nbr=12456)`

### 5.8.2 Earnings Statements UI fixes

2018-11-09

Fixes:

+ Remove stray angle brace in Payroll Information UI.
+ Reflect error and empty earnings statements cases in Payroll Information UI.
+ Predicate checkbox about showing earnings amounts on there being earnings amounts to show.
+ Add hint about emplids to demonstrate earnings statements in QA.

### 5.8.1 include `earningsStatements` in model for `payrollInformation.jsp`

2018-11-09

Fix:

+ 5.8.1 `payrollInformation` JSP expected a model attribute `earningsStatements` but the controller
  did not include that attribute in the mode. This fixes the controller to include the expected
  data.

### 5.8.0 Generate earnings statements table server-side rather than client-side

2018-11-09

Changed:

+ Radically changed earnings statements table implementation to render server-side rather than
  client-side and thereby get out from under Fluid and DataList complexity. There is JSON available
  for this data so a future modern-libraries client-side UI is possible. In the meantime, moving
  this table generation server-side eases current changes to support HRS earnings statements and
  their per-statement URLs.
+ Changed `SimpleEarningsStatement` property names to match those in legacy
  Cypress-specific `EarningStatement` and so to require less change in the front
  end to integrate with the new JSON.

### 5.7.1 Fix EarningStatementDataController

2018-11-09

Fix:

+ The new resource URL introduced in 5.7.0 was broken because the JavaBean setter for injecting the
  dependency on the new earnings statement DAO was broken. This fixes it.

### 5.7.0 JSON resource URL for new HRS-sourced earnings statements

2018-11-09

New feature:

+ Adds JSON resource URL exposing the new HRS-sourced earnings statements.

Fix:

+ Added audit logging to HRS integration troubleshooter. ( [HRSPLT-394][] )

### 5.6.0 HRS Earnings Statements in Troubleshooter

2018-11-08

New feature:

+ Implements getting earnings statements from HRS, but just Troubleshooter-deep.

Fixes:

+ Consistently refer to earnings statements as "earnings" statements, not
  "earning" statements. ( [HRSPLT-391][] )
+ Sort roles in troubleshooter ( [HRSPLT-390][] )
+ Remove `@version` annotations in code that had been populated with stale
  metadata from the previous, no-longer-in-use versioning system (SVN). (
  [#155][] )

### 5.5.0 - ROLE_LINK_TO_CLASSIC_ESS_ABS_BAL, timeAndAbsenceFName

2018-11-06

#### New features in 5.5.0

+ Add supporting text in Payroll Information cueing visiting Time and Absence to
  view leave balances, since leave balances will no longer be available on
  earnings statements starting in 2019. If the optional `portlet-preference`
  `timeAndAbsenceFName` is set, this supporting text includes a hyperlink easing
  employee navigation to Time and Absence. ( [HRSPLT-386][], [#153][] )
+ Predicate the preference for the link to `Classic ESS Abs Bal` introduced in
  hrs-portlets 5.3.0 upon the employee holding a newly invented hrs-portlets
  role `ROLE_LINK_TO_CLASSIC_ESS_ABS_BAL`. If the employee does not hold this
  role, show the status quo leave balances table.
  This is moot for employees also holding `ROLE_REDIRECT_TO_HRS_FLUID_TIME`
  iff the `Fluid Time` HRS URL is set, since they'll be redirected to HRS
  self-service `Fluid Time` anyway. ( [HRSPLT-384][], [#152][] )
+ New button "View Leave Balances" in Time and Absence, implementing that link
  to `Classic ESS Abs Bal`, and predicated on that URL being defined. This
  replaces the button and supporting text that had been included in the Leave
  Balances tab when `Classic ESS Abs Bal` was defined, as of 5.3.0. (
  [HRSPLT-384][], [#152][] )
+ Map from HRS role `UW_DYN_AM_Employee` to newly invented hrs-portlets role
  `ROLE_LINK_TO_CLASSIC_ESS_ABS_BAL`. That is, the HRS role `UW_DYN_AM_EMPLOYEE`
  is required to see the new link to `Classic ESS Abs Bal`. Employees lacking
  this role continue to see leave balances as of their most recent earnings
  statement directly included in the "Leave Balances" tab in "Time and Absence".
  ( [HRSPLT-384][], [#152][] )
+ Adjusted supporting text on Leave Balances tab to no longer set expectation
  as to whether earnings statements include leave balances, while continuting to
  clarify as of when the leave balances shown in the table are current.
  Enhanced with optional link to the corresponding Payroll Information iff a new
  `portlet-preference` `payrollInformationFName` is set. ( [HRSPLT-384][],
  [#152][] )

#### Removed features in 5.5.0

+ Employees with new `ROLE_LINK_TO_CLASSIC_ESS_ABS_BAL` will no longer see the
  Leave Balances tab in Time and Absence, so long as that role was actualized by
  the URL for that link being set so the button rendered. ( [HRSPLT-384][],
  [#152][] )
+ The portlet-preference `dynamicLeaveBalancesLearnMoreUrl` introduced in 5.3.0
  to optionally define a supporting link for learning more about dynamic leave
  balances no longer has any effect, since the explanatory text it had been
  supporting has been removed from the UI. ( [HRSPLT-384][], [#152][] )

### 5.4.0 - redirect UW_DYN_AM_ESS_FLU_MONTHLY to Fluid Time

2018-11-02

+ Redirect employees with the new `ROLE_REDIRECT_TO_HRS_FLUID_TIME` MyUW
  hrs-portlets role from MyUW Time and Absence to the new HRS self-service
  `Fluid Time` page. That role signifies employees whose time and absence
  reporting needs are fully met by the new `Fluid Time` UI and so for whom the
  best available experience is to go directly to HRS `Fluid Time`. (
  [HRSPLT-381][] , [#150][] )
+ Map from new HRS role `UW_DYN_AM_ESS_FLU_MONTHLY` to new MyUW hrs-portlets
  role `ROLE_REDIRECT_TO_HRS_FLUID_TIME`. ( [HRSPLT-382][], [#150][] )

### 5.3.0 - leave balances and garnishments links

2018-10-30

+ Prefer to link new HRS URL `Classic ESS Abs Bal` rather than display leave
  balances directly on "Leave Balances" tab in "Time and Absence" (
  [HRSPLT-377][] , [#148][])
+ Add new `Garnishments/Wage Assignments` link in Payroll Information -->
  Earnings Statements tab, to new HRS URL `Fluid Garnishments`, conditioned on
  that `Fluid Garnishments` URL being set and the viewing employee having
  `ROLE_VIEW_OWN_GARNISHMENTS` ( [HRSPLT-378][] , [#149][] )
+ Map new `UW_DYN_PY_ESS_GARNISHMENTS` HRS role to new
  `ROLE_VIEW_OWN_GARNISHMENTS` hrs-portlets role ( [HRSPLT-379][] , [#149][] )
+ Document new `Fluid Garnishments` HRS URL as
  `HrsUrlDao.SELF_SERVICE_VIEW_GARNISHMENTS_KEY` ( [HRSPLT-378][] , [#149][] )

### 5.2.0 - Re-add Direct Deposit and W4 links

2018-10-22

+ "Update your Direct Deposit" link added to MyUW Payroll Information, on the
  "Earnings Statements" tab, since this is the form for adjusting where those
  earnings are deposited and so employees might expect to find it in an earnings
  statements context. When the user has `ROLE_VIEW_DIRECT_DEPOSIT` and the HRS
  URL `Direct Deposit` is present, links to that URL, otherwise links to static
  PDF form. ( [#147][], [HRSPLT-376][] )
+ "Update your W4" link added to MyUW Payroll Information, on the "Tax
  Statements" tab since W4 is the form for adjusting tax witholdings and so
  employees might expect to find it in a tax context. ( [#146][],
  [HRSPLT-375][])

### 5.1.2 - overcome artifact publication glitch

2018-10-19

It's 5.1.1 except actually published to artifact repositories.

### 5.1.1 - fix benefitInformation.jsp syntax error

2018-10-18

Bugged release: not actually published to artifact repositories.

+ Fix syntax error in `benefitInformation.jsp`

### 5.1.0 - add View/Update Dependent Information link

2018-10-18

#### New feature in 5.1.0

+ Adds "View/Update Dependent Information" link in Benefit Information, as the
  preferred link that when present replaces the legacy "View Dependent Details"
  link. The "View/Update Dependent Information" link appears iff the
  "Dependent/Beneficiary Info" HRS URL is present (and links to that URL). (
  [#145][], [HRSPLT-372][] )

### 5.0.0 - remove Direct Deposit and W4 links

2018-10-18

#### New features in 5.0.0

+ Adds Payroll Information resource URL for an employee to download their latest earnings statement.
  ( [#142][], [HRSPLT-368][] )

#### Fixes in 5.0.0

+ Fix Payroll Information table of tax statements to stop offering a sort UI
  control to sort on the name of the statement. Sorting by name is more
  confusing than it is helpful. Retains sort by statement year. ( [#141][],
  [HRSPLT-365][] )

#### Removed features in 5.0.0

+ "Update your Direct Deposit" link removed from Payroll Information (
  [#143][], [HRSPLT-370][])
+ "Update your W4" link removed from Payroll Information ( [#144][],
  [HRSPLT-371][])

## HRS Portlets 4 series

The HRS Portlets 4 major version was occasioned by the breaking change of
changing the meaning of `ROLE_VIEW_WEB_CLOCK`.

### 4.1.1

2018-10-15

+ Fix syntax error that caused the new Payroll Information links in 4.1.0 not
  to show.

### 4.1.0 Payroll Information deep links to tabs and links into HRS

2018-10-15

#### New features in 4.1.0

+ Payroll Information shows links to `View W-2`, `View 1095-C`, `W-2 Consent`,
  and `1095-C Consent`, iff it reads those URLs from the HRS URLs DAO. (No
  interdependency - each handled individually.) ( [#137][], [HRSPLT-362][],
  [HRSPLT-363][] )
+ Optionally deep link to a specific tab in Payroll Information by setting the
  `requestedContent` *Portlet* request parameter. Specifically, setting this to
  `Tax Statements` will select the "Tax Statements" tab, whereas omitting it or
  any other value will continue the default behavior of initially selecting the
  "Earning Statements" tab. Note that this is only practically useful when
  invoking the Portlet in a way that conveys portlet request parameters. i.e.
  the status quo naive `/web/exclusive/{fname}` in uPortal App Framework does
  not support this feature, whereas the legacy `/portal/p/{fname}` does *if* you
  indulge a modest abstraction violation and rely on knowledge of how uPortal
  names *Portlet* request parameters, i.e.
  `/portal/p/{fname}?pP_requestedContent=Tax%20Statements` . This is all by way
  of temporizing until the HRS Portlets can be replaced by implementations that
  are not Portlets, e.g. uPortal Application Framework applications.

### 4.0.0: `ROLE_VIEW_HRS_APPROVALS_WIDGET`, role refactor and apis, redirector

2018-10-04

#### Breaking changes in 4.0.0

This release refactors roles in "Time and Absence", inventing in-hrs-portlets
roles more explicitly mapping to UI controls and functions in hrs-portlets.
( [#125][] )

This is a breaking change in the sense that some previous roles disappear or
or change meaning, and new roles appear.

This is a non-breaking change, indeed a
no-discernible-impact-to-HRS-or-to-employees change in the sense that the
mapping from PeopleSoft roles to portlet roles is carefully ported forward such
that the same PeopleSoft roles result in the same privileges and experiences in
hrs-portlets.

Invents:

+ `ROLE_TIMESHEET_BUTTON`, gating display of the Timesheet button
+ `ROLE_VIEW_TIME_ENTRY_HISTORY`, gating access to Time Entry history data and
  display of this tab in Time and Absence

Removes:

+ `ROLE_VIEW_TIME_SHEET`
+ `ROLE_VIEW_TIME_CLOCK`

both of which had previously granted both access to the Timesheet button and
access to time entry history.

Changes the meaning of:

+ `ROLE_VIEW_WEB_CLOCK`, which now only grants the "Web Clock" link, but
  previously had also granted access to the Timesheet button and time entry
  history.

#### New features in 4.0.0

+ Adds `ROLE_VIEW_HRS_APPROVALS_WIDGET`, initially mapped from HRS roles
  `UW_DYN_PY_ADDL_PAY_APP` and `UW_UNV_TL Supervisor` ( [#128][], [#132][] )
+ As a *Servlet* in the HRSPortlets web application, adds `/go` redirector that
  takes a `urlKey` request parameter. When this maps to a URL known to the
  HrsUrlsDao, redirects to that URL. When this does not map to a URL known to
  that DAO, responds 404 not found. ( [#126][] )
+ Adds a JSON resource URL for asking whether the user has a specific HRS
  Portlets role. Intended for use in `switch` widget type to switch widget
  behavior on whether user has role. ( [ #127][] )
+ Adds a JSON resource URL for asking what portlet roles the user does and does
  not have. Intended for use in uPortal App Framework message filtering.
  Structured similarly to `enrollmentFlag` for this reason. ( [#129][] )

## HRS Portlets 3 series

The HRS Portlets 3 major version was occasioned by the breaking change of
changing the meaning of `ROLE_VIEW_ABSENCE_HISTORIES`.

### 3.1.0: targeted notifications and notices for PHIT

#### New features in 3.1.0

+ In Time and Absence, a new optional `portlet-preference`
  `dynPunchTimesheetNotification` drives a new in-HRS-app message (presented
  just like `notification`) to employees with the new
  `ROLE_UW_DYN_AM_PUNCH_TIME` role. ( [HRSPLT-346][], [#123][] )
+ In Time and Absence, a new optional `portlet-preference`
  `nonDynPunchTimesheetNotification` drives a new in-HRS-app message (presented
  just like `notification`) to employees who see the Timesheet button but who
  do not have the new `ROLE_UW_DYN_AM_PUNCH_TIME` role. ( [HRSPLT-346][],
  [#123][] )
+ In Time and Absence, a new optional `portlet-preference`
  `dynPunchTimesheetNotice` drives a new message near the Timesheet button
  (presented similarly to `timesheetNotice`) to employees with the new
  `ROLE_UW_DYN_AM_PUNCH_TIME` role. ( [HRSPLT-346][], [#123][] )

#### Changes in 3.1.0

+ In Time and Absence, the `leaveReportingNotice` when present is now ordered
  ahead of general `hrs:notifications` in-app notifications when present.
  ( [HRSPLT-348][], [#122][] )

### 3.0.0: split `ROLE_VIEW_ABSENCE_HISTORIES`

#### Breaking changes in 3.0.0

The `ROLE_VIEW_ABSENCE_HISTORIES` portlet role now *only*
grants access to view absence histories and does *not* grant access to the
"Enter absence" and "Edit/cancel absence" buttons. (Access to those buttons is
now granted by new portlet role `ROLE_ENTER_EDIT_CANCEL_OWN_ABSENCES`).

Migration path: to the extent that employees ought to continue to have all the
privileges of the prior implementation of `ROLE_VIEW_ABSENCE_HISTORIES`, also
grant those employees `ROLE_ENTER_EDIT_CANCEL_OWN_ABSENCES`. ( #121 )

#### New features in 3.0.0

+ Add new portlet role `ROLE_ENTER_EDIT_CANCEL_OWN_ABSENCES`, granting access to
  the "Enter absence" and "Edit/cancel absence buttons". This access is a subset
  of what `ROLE_VIEW_ABSENCE_HISTORIES` historically granted. ( #121 )
+ Add role mapping for new `UW_DYN_AM_PUNCH_TIME` HRS role. This HRS role grants
  `ROLE_VIEW_ABSENCE_HISTORIES` portlet role but does *not* grant new
  `ROLE_ENTER_EDIT_CANCEL_OWN_ABSENCES` portlet role. ( #121 )

#### Changes in 3.0.0

+ Update role mapping for `UW_DYN_AM_EMPLOYEE` HRS role to grant the new
  `ROLE_ENTER_EDIT_CANCEL_OWN_ABSENCES` portlet role in addition to the
  `ROLE_VIEW_ABSENCE_HISTORIES` portlet role it was already granting. This
  yields *no functional change* for employees with the `UW_DYN_AM_EMPLOYEE` HRS
  role. While `ROLE_VIEW_ABSENCE_HISTORIES` is losing privileges in this
  release, these employees regain those very same privileges via the
  `ROLE_ENTER_EDIT_CANCEL_OWN_ABSENCES` role. ( #121 )

## HRS Portlets 2 series

The HRS Portlets 2 major version was occasioned by the breaking change of
adding two methods to the Roles DAO API.

### 2.1.1 : Eagerly resolve leave reporting notice div conditional

2018-06-25

Fixed

+ Eagerly resolve whether to show leave reporting notice div ( #119 )

### 2.1.0

2018-06-04

New features

+ Add `leaveReportingNotice` feature in Time and Absence ( #118 )
+ Style HRS roles as <em>emphasized</em> as used as sentences in Troubleshooter
  ( #116 )

### 2.0.0 : Troubleshooter with more detail

2018-05-16

#### Breaking change in 2.0.0

Changes the Roles DAO API to add two methods, supporting

 + Enhanced Troubleshooting portlet, now with what HRS roles are known, the
   general mappings from HRS roles to Portlet roles, and a link to documentation
   ( #115 )

## HRS Portlets 1 series

### 1.12.0 : Roles troubleshooter

2018-05-14

#### New features in 1.12.0

+ Add `Troubleshooting` portlet ( #114 )
+ Require secure database connections by setting
  `;oracle.net.encryption_client=REQUIRED;` on `connectionProperties`
  ( 1b749187006099bea1448ac8a29e5cd69eb3f62a )

### 1.11.0 : Configurable Manager Time and Approval link labels

2018-04-16

Adjusts defaults for Manager Time and Approval dynamic hyperlink labels, and
makes these labels configurable via `portlet-preference`.

+ Title case and make configurable Manager "Approve Absence" and "Approve Time"
  link labels ( #111 )
+ shorten "Time/Absence Dashboard" label ( #112 )

### 1.10.0 : Dynamic Manager Time and Approval fixes and improvements

2018-04-13

Feature changes

+ Re-orders "HRS Manager Time and Approval" links to put "Approve absence" ahead
  of "Approve time". This is intended to better match typical manager approval
  workflows and a customization also made in the new HRS self-service Fluid
  approvals dashboard. ( #109 )
+ Shortens the default label for the new manager approval dashboard link in
  "Manager Time and Approval" to "Time & Absence Dashboard" so that it will not
  run over the 24 character limit and be truncated by the `list-of-links` widget
  type. ( #110 )

Bug fixes

+ Fix the "Approve time" link in the new dynamic Manager Time and Approval
  manager links ( #107 )
+ Fix URLs JSON to actually include the URLs (values) and not just the keys.
  That is, to make the list-of-link representation of this links that are actual
  hyperlinks that link to the URLs. ( #108 )

### 1.9.1 : Fix display of a button in Time and Absence

2018-04-12

Patch release to fix a display issue on a button in the Time And Absence app.

### 1.9.0 : Dynamic manager links widget

2018-03-29

New features: ManagerLinks portlet

+ `ManagerLinks` portlet, exposing a resource URL vending JSON in
  `list-of-links` format, representing role-filtered links available to the
  manager to launch into HRS self-service to approve time and/or absences ( #97,
  #100, #101, #102 )
+ Optional approvals dashboard link, with its label and URL specified via
  portlet preference, predicated on new `UW_DYN_TIME_ABS_DASH_USER` HRS role (
  #99, #103,  #104 )
+ Also offers equivalent rendered view, suitable for linking from the generated
  `list-of-links` widget.

New features: Roles portlet

+ `Roles` portlet, exposing a resource URL vending JSON in `list-of-links`
  format, representing the user's HRS roles as understood by (mapped to) the HRS
  Portlets (  #96 ).
+ Also offers equivalent rendered view, suitable for linking from the generated
  `list-of-links` widget.

New features:: Urls portlet

+ `Urls` portlet, exposing a resource URL vending JSON in `list-of-links`
  format, representing the HRS URLs as understood by the HRS Portlets
+ Also offers equivalent rendered view, suitable for linking from the generated
  `list-of-links` widget.

Style

+ Trivial whitespace fixes ( #98 )

### 1.8.0 : Approvals count JSON API

2018-02-14

New features:

+ JSON API to read quantity of viewer's pending approvals ( #94 )
+ Configurable link for "your human resource contact" in Personal Information (
  #95 )

### 1.7.0 : Tweaks including updated year-end-leave-balances label

2018-01-12

Changes:

+ Update year-end-leave-balances label for end of 2017. ( #92 )

Fixes:

+ Removes duplicate zero-balance vacation carryover entries in leave balances (
  #87 )
+ Changes advice about changing "Business/Office Address" to contact "your human
  resources office" rather than "your Payroll Office". ( #91 )
+ Revise Benefit Statement ordering ( #93 )

### 1.6.5 : Change spacing

2017-11-03

+ Fixes spacing of paragraphs ( #86 )

### 1.6.4 : More conservative Personal Information presentation

2017-10-26

There are no functional or configuration changes in this release.

+ Makes more conservative the HRS PUM22 changes previously made in ( #75 )
  characterizing and linking the self-service UI for updating personal
  information in HRS. ( #85 )

### 1.6.3 : further fix new direct deposit self-service link feature

2017-10-24

1.6.0's new feature ( #80 ) was bugged. 1.6.1 tried to fix this, but it was
still bugged. Further fixes with ( #82 )

### 1.6.2 : unpublished

This release did not successfully publish. Its fix is documented above in 1.6.3.

### 1.6.1 : failed attempt at fixing bugged self-service direct deposit linking

2017-10-24

Attempted to fix bugged ( #80 ) with ( #81 ), but it didn't work.

### 1.6.0 : bugged link to HRS self-service direct deposit UI

2017-10-24

BUGGED. (Use `1.6.3` or later instead.)

This release adds one feature: support for an optional HRS role granting access
to the new self-service direct deposit management UI in PeopleSoft 9.2 PUM22. (
#80 ).

This is entirely backwards compatible and fails gracefully, falling back on
v1.5.0 behavior:

+ If the viewing employee does not have the new role (HRS role
  `UW_DYN_PY_DIRDEP_SS`, mapped to an hrs-portlets role of
  `ROLE_VIEW_DIRECT_DEPOSIT`), the UI is unchanged, continuing to link a PDF
  form for direct deposit updating (as hardcoded in the JSP).
+ If the new portlet-preference `directDepositSelfServiceUrl` is not set,
  *even if the employee has the new role*, the UI is unchanged, continuing to
  link a PDF form for direct deposit updating (as hardcoded in the JSP).

If the employee has the role and the portlet-preference is set, the direct
deposit link in the UI uses the URL configured in the portlet preference
(intention: the HRS self-service URL) rather than the previously hard-coded URL
to the PDF form.

(The portlet preference could be configured with any URL, including with the URL
to the PDF form, so that's another way to turn off this new feature in a pinch.)

### 1.5.0 : Benefit Summary URL portlet preference

2017-10-12

New feature:

+ Optionally, the benefit summary URL link in Benefit Information can be
  specified via the new `benefitsSummaryUrl` portlet-preference, overriding any
  value coming through the HRS URLs SOAP integration. ( #78 as fixed in #79 ).

Backwards compatible: don't set the new preference and the portlet continues to
function as in `1.4.0`.

### 1.4.0 : add Edit/Cancel Absences button

New feature:

+ Adds support in Time and Absence for new optional `editCancelAbsenceUrl`
  portlet-preference . When set, shows new Edit/Cancel Absence button to launch
  the URL described by that portlet-preference value. When not set, no-op.
  Intended to support graceful upgrade to HRS PUM22 self-service UIs. ( #76 )

Fix:

+ `1.3.0` was bugged bug such that when the Personal Information self-service
  launch URL was configured via the new-in-that-release optional
  `updateMyPersonalInfoUrl` portlet-preference, the resulting UI included broken
  hyperlinks. This release fixes that bug. ( #77 )

### 1.3.0 : add Personal Information self-service URL portlet-preference

2017-10-06

New feature:

+ honor optional `updateMyPersonalInfoUrl` portlet preference superseding
  corresponding URL from HRS SOAP web service ( #75 )

This release adds support for overriding the URL linking to HRS self-service UI
for updating personal information, via a new `updateMyPersonalInfoUrl` portlet
preference.

+ When the preference is set, the UI reflects the new HRS PUM22 context (text,
  other links around) for the link.
+ When the preference is not set, the portlet continues to get this URL from the
  HRS URLs SOAP web service with its prior context (text, other links around)
  the link.
+ This release also adds an error state for when the URL is available neither
  from the portlet preference nor from the HRS URLs web service. This edge case
  is not expected to actually happen in practice.

### 1.2.0 : enrollmentFlag API and service window message

2017-09-29

New features:

+ Add enrollmentFlag resource mapping (portlet resource URL) ( #74 )
+ Note HRS service window in footers within the portlet UIs ( #72 )
+ Add trace logging in enrollment flag parsing ( #73 )


### 1.1.3 : workaround fixing Leave Reports column disappearance

2017-09-21

Fix:

+ Workaround to resolve race condition affecting display of Leave Reports column
  ( #71 )


### 1.1.2 : add enrollmentFlag to benefitSummary JSON API; rm furlough balance

2017-07-24

New features:

+ Adds `enrollmentFlag` to `benefitSummary` resource URL ( #69 )
+ Filters furlough balance from leave balances, if furlough balance is zero (
